# Step 1: Confirm Lab Setup
- [X] I have forked the repository and created my lab report
- [X] If I'm collaborating on this project, I have included their handles on the report and confirm that my report is informed, but not copied from my collaborators.

# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Indeed | 19/20 | Indeed has a clean crisp UI that is easy to use and does a good job of providing the answers you need to find the best job for you to get. Also since the UI is clean, crisp and simple that also means that it is easy for anyone to use. |
| Monster | 13/20 | While Monster is also a good job board, I found it to be too much all at once, the UI is often too confusing and would most certainly be extremely difficult if you needed to do the job search on something that doesn't let you use a mouse. |

## 2.2 Site 1
Insert Recorded Screenshots with captions and steps.
Indeed
| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |  3 |  I thought that it was very intuitive, it is easy to understand and nothing is too complex at all. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 2  |  The site seemed to value my time, it is fairly basic however and there is no need to talk to anyone through a chatbot or something |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |  3 | I think that Indeed is very crisp and clear. Everything is intuitive and easy to understand  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  |  You can pick and choose what you are looking for, so in that sense it is clear and easy to get path out of |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  3 |  The site seemed to use copy well |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3  |  Simple navigation and click through pretty easy to understand |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? |  2 |  Could be better obviously a mouse would improve performance, however it wasn't bad by any means. |
| **TOTAL** | 19  |   |

## 2.3 Site 2
Insert Recorded Screenshots with captions and steps.
Monster
| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |  2 |  Less intuitive, the design was less basic so I needed to think more to navigate through it. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  2 |  The site seemed to value my time decently well, similar to Indeed, it did not go above and beyond yet it didn't lack either. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2  | It did do a decent job of making things clear, yet did not go above and beyond  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 1  |  Mostly just a general area, lots of options yet hard to get the specifics of anything. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3  | Had a good use of copy  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 2  |  The navigation and workflow was decent yet not amazing |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 1  | Since the UI is more complex I think it would be near impossible on a mouseless interface  |
| **TOTAL** | 13  |   |
