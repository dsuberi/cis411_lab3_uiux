# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn | 9/10 | The site was well organized, condensed while still being readable. I have been on LinkdIn before so I am somewhat familiar with the format but it is a nice touch that for incomplete profiles they give you a "nudge" to complete it in a non-intrusive way |
| Indeed | 8/10  | The login was typical of any site. However for creating a password it was clear that it was desired for them to have you connect your google account as opposed to making a separated account. Inserting job listings were easy on the surface however there was practically nothing for cybersecurity or computer science. Applying for a jo however had a nice touch where clicking apply it opened a new tab. Overall good experience |

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2  |  The site was passable, some things however could have been more intuitive. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 2  | Not clear advertisements however popups which were essentially useless.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 1  |  There were multiple times where I was stopped due to the language used. Instead of saying something is necessarry before continuing it simply say's that it needs to be done with no time context. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 2  | It did what I believe could have been it's best to lead me to where I would have liked to have been. It still did guide me into the general topic.   |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  3 |  I see no over-usage of words or jargon within my navigational experience on the site |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |  3 | Straightforward, At least for onboarding most steps are right after the other.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? |  3 |  The buttons do seem slightly larger and would not pose as much of a problem for touchscreen users  |
| **TOTAL** |  16  |  |

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |  3 |  It was a very streamlined experience with no unecessary pop-ups |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  3  | Through the entire process there was only 1 pop-up and it was meant to help you as opposed to an advetisment or a "suggestion" to look at another part of the site.   |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |  3 | Elements that the site wantd you to look at were always different in colour scheme. Example being the job listing portion.  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  |  Yes it did, It didn't stray far from the job I had inserted into the search bar. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  2 | It can be argued that some things could have been more designed, but it's simply the nature of the site.  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |  3 |  Smooth, I can recall no hiccups during browsing  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? |  2  | Perhaps the styling is set to automatically be larger when a touch screen is in use, however I feel as if the buttons in the current state may be too small to not have a finger cover them.  |
| **TOTAL** | 19   |   |
