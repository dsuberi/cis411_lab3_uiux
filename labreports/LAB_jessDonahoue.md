# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Indeed | 8/10 | Very active with job postings, but some applications take you to another website. Few applications let you "quick apply" directly from Indeed. |
| LinkedIn | 7/10 | Personalized job picks based on skill level and interests. A lot of features are locked behind a monthly subscription. |
