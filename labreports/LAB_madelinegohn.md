# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| [Site 1](https://www.linkedin.com/) | 18 | Between the two sites, I did not pick LinkedIn as my preferred site, but as I went through the scores, LinkedIn had a higher score. Overall, this site was easier to use, had more features, and had an easier time connecting with employers and peers. |
| [Site 2](https://www.indeed.com/) | 15 | This was the site I picked to have as a preferred site; however, this site was not as good as I originally thought it was. It was frustrating to navigate at times, and there was a more difficult time trying to select and save jobs to apply for. |

## 2.2 Site 1
Insert Recorded Screenshots with captions and steps.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2 |There is a nice layout at the top of the site. Easy options to choose from. Easy to connect with colleagues. Easy to find jobs.|
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3 |Once you go onto the job section, there are different groupings based on your inputted information.|
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |3|There are sections with bookmarked jobs, interview prep, and a resume builder. The lack of contrast in the colors makes for blended viewing.|
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? |3|Yes. Based on the information you provide with connections, resume, desired work place experiences, this site carefully tailors jobs for you.|
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |3|Words that are copied are copied for a reason. The site has limited vocabulary to help you select the jobs you want.|
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |2.5|The overall navigation wasn't bad. Enhanced searches are blocked behind a paywall. Indeed does give a month free for their Premium service.|
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? |1.5|It has a decent amount of accessibility option, but the screen reader that is loaded onto the computer has hard time identifying the words on the screen.|
| **TOTAL** |18|   |

## 2.3 Site 2
Insert Recorded Screenshots with captions and steps.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |2.5|The main point of this site is finding jobs, which it does a great job of; however, if you are not logged in, more jobs are shown than when you are.|
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |2|Aside from a few filters, searching for a job you want takes time.|
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |2|Using this site is intuitive, except for navigating to your profile, especially when the site is minimized.|
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? |3|When you go through the site, you are shown exactly what to do|
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |3|It uses very limited words, and the words it does use are important to searching.|
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |1.5|If you find a job you like and it is still available, searching for it may be difficult.|
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? |1|Like LinkedIn, Indeed has a hard time using a screen reader.|
| **TOTAL** |15|   |
