# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Indeed (indeed.com) | 15 | A deservedly popular job search website that is streamlined and simple in its execution of its mission. |
| Ladders (theladders.com) | 5 | A very poor option to use for finding work, that constantly throws its "premium services" in your face upon account creation. |

## 2.2 Site 1

Once an account has been created, you will first be prompted with where you would like to work, in addition to whether or not you would like to do remote work.
![alt text](image-1.png)
You are then prompted with what is the minimum amount of pay you are willing to work for. Not only can you input what amount you'd like, but you can specify the rate: this helps distinguish between hourly rated jobs and salaried jobs.
![alt text](image-2.png)
Next, you input the job titles that you are looking for, pre-selected from job titles that Indeed already has in its system; you can select up to ten job titles.
![alt text](image-3.png)
Here is an example of a job that meets the criteria shown in the example: pays at least $75,000/year, is within IT, and is based near Milford, CT.

This particular job uses Workday as its means of receiving and processing job applications.

This is the first step of the application form once you create or log into your Workday account. Presuming I input everything for my application based off of my resume, all that is left is to confirm your application details and to submit it.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2  | Upon creating an account, you are prompted with fields to input information that helps in the job search (e.g., location, working remote, min. salary, etc.) This allows for a streamlined access to whichever jobs one is looking for. One flaw with how Indeed sets up its job hunting capabilities is that it filters based off of predetermined job titles, which ruled out a few jobs that I would have otherwise looked for. The jobs they do have on their list are still robust, however.  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3  | At no point in using Indeed did I feel that I was being marketed some other product or good, nor that there was some ulterior motive in what I was being presented: I was being given a succinct, comprehensible vector for job searching, and it did nothing to extend this process any longer than necessary.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2  | This is intertwined with how intuitive the site is, in that the design of the website itself helps to make it overall easier to use. The process for going about each step in Indeed's job search methodology was clear and without adulterations, though isn't very large in scope.  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 2  | Supposing that this means that the site doesn't push you towards an opinionated path, I would say that Indeed does a great job at not pushing you towards one discipline or industry over another, and allows the user to customize their job search experience with relative clarity.  |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3  | Very little is redundent or unnecessary in the website design for Indeed.  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 2  | Not difficult at all to find your way around, and was structurally sensible in its layout.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 1  | Naturally you can access this website off of a mobile device, but it's clearly optimized for a mouse-and-keyboard computer.  |
| **TOTAL** | 15  |   |

## 2.3 Site 2

This is the home page for Ladders. The majority of the front page is taken up by the sign-in window, which prompts you about your current job, and what you are looking for: this is the first flaw in its design. By presuming ahead of time you were previously employed (with a salary, no less), it seems like unnecessary information for your current job search.
![alt text](image-7.png)
Clicking the "sign up" button will open a window that asks for the same information that the homepage already has.
![alt text](image-8.png)
Here is some sample information put into the fields.
![alt text](image-9.png)
Here it asks for your first and last name, plus your zip code. I used mine here as an example.
![alt text](image-10.png)
Finally, it asks for your email and a password to create an account.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 1  | The format for how you actually input what you want for your parameters for jobs is jarring and requires previous experience to fill out in the field, which presumes you've already worked a salaried job.  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 0  | This site was very clearly trying to advertise its "premium" service instead of actually listing jobs, and it definitely got in the way of actually using its services.s  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 1  | The initial account set-up lets you set relatively clear parameters, but from there it gets less easy to navigate.  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 2  | Surprisingly, Ladders is pretty open-ended with the job positions you wish to pursue, but obviously this search is hampered by other insufficiencies.  |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 1  | The site continues to refer you back to the purchase screen for the premium service without being prompted, which greatly disrupts the whole process.  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 0  | Because of the reoccurring premium purchase screen, the workflow was jarring and constantly fighting against you.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 0  | The site is barely useable upon account creation / log-in even on a normal computer, using a mobile device would be even worse.  |
| **TOTAL** | 5  |   |
